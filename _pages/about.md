My general interests are programming languages and compilers.
I explore new ways of programming complex systems, in order to make them simpler, safer,
more robust, and more scalable. 

I am a strong proponent of functional programming and formal methods, and a logician
at heart.

My [contributions](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/)
span the areas of functional programming, effect systems, 
type theory, verification, distributed/reactive programming, 
stream/event processing, and symbolic execution. 

Being not too picky, I work with both [first- and second-class](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2983990.2984009) functions.
When I [reflect]( https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/237721.237784) upon an issue, I tend
to reify new ideas. I survived callback hell by [shifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimited_continuation) my perspective. 
Pondering if the world can [handle my effects](https://www.eff-lang.org/handlers-tutorial.pdf) and what [coeffect](http://tomasp.net/coeffects)
it grants me.  Always the strong type, sometimes [existential](https://doi.org/10.1145/44501.45065), and 
increasingly becoming [dependent](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Martin-L%C3%B6f+dependent+type+theory). 


I am always looking for talented and strongly motivated students to work on a thesis or research
project.
