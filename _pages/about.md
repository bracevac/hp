My general interests are programming languages and compilers.
I explore new ways of programming complex systems, in order to make them simpler, safer and 
more robust.  

My [contributions](publications/) span the areas of functional programming, effect systems, 
type theory, verification, distributed/reactive programming, 
stream/event processing, and symbolic execution. 

I am a strong proponent of functional programming and formal methods, and a logician
at heart.  I like my functions first-class, but do not scoff when they are second-class.
I am not too shy to call a continuation twice. When I reflect upon an issue, I tend
to reify new ideas. Pondering what is my effect on the world and what coeffect
it grants me.  Always the strong type, sometimes existential, and increasingly dependent. 

I am always looking for talented and strongly motivated students to work on a thesis or research
project.
